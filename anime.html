                        out of pleasure. <br>
                        To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living

                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous 
                        humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind 
                        enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that 
                        their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be 
                        out of pleasure. <br>
                        To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living 
                        within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan 
                        encounter.
